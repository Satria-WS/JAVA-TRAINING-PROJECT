//##Basic Syxtax:


- Access Modifiers: These modifiers control the scope of class and methods.
- Understanding Access Modifiers: (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-basic-syntax/)

- data type in java ,  primitive data types & Non primitive data types
- primitive : boolean , char , byte , short , int , long , float ,double 


- Java Variable Type Conversion & Type Casting :
//This process is Automatic, and non-explicit is known as Conversion
double d;
int i = 10;
d = i;

//This process is known as Type Casting ,  and explicitly specify the type cast operator
double d = 10;
int i;
i = (int)d;


//##Data Type Variables
- There are three types of variables in Java: local variable ,instance variable,static variable
- There are two types of data types in Java: primitive and non-primitive.
- A local variable cannot be defined with "static" keyword.
- static pada variable , nilainya dapat di pertahankan (https://www.javatpoint.com/static-keyword-in-java)

-  Local Variables , other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists.
-  Instance Variable , It is called an instance variable because not shared among instances
-  Static variable , can be share it among all the instances of the class
- Entities ,  lightweight persistence domain object. Typically, an entity represents a table in a relational database, and each entity instance corresponds to a row in that table.



//##class
//refrence https://www.javatpoint.com/object-and-class-in-java
- class in Java can contain: fields , methods , constructor , blocks , nested class and interface
- Initializing an object means storing data into the object.
//Java Program to illustrate how to define a class and fields  
//Defining a Student class.  
class Student{  
 //defining fields  
 int id;//field or data member or instance variable  
 String name;  
 //creating main method inside the Student class  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
  //Creating an object or instance  
  Student s1=new Student();//creating an object of Student  
  //Printing values of the object  
  System.out.println(s1.id);//accessing member through reference variable  
  System.out.println(s1.name);  
 }  
} 

  //Creating objects  
  Student s1=new Student();  
  Student s2=new Student();  
  //Initializing objects  
  s1.id=101; 


- There are many ways to create an object in java. They are:  new keyword,newInstance() method,clone() method, deserialization, factory method.

- Anonymous object , Anonymous simply means nameless. An object which has no reference is known as an anonymous object. It can be used at the time of object creation only.

//##Datastructures
- As the name indicates itself, a Data Structure is a way of organizing the data in the memory so that it can be used efficiently
- Some common data structures are array, linked list, stack, hashtable, queue, tree, heap, and graph.
